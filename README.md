# picoCTF Solutions

Welcome to my repository where I'll be documenting my journey through the [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) challenges! picoCTF is a cybersecurity competition designed to teach and improve skills related to hacking, cryptography, reverse engineering, forensics, and more.

## About This Repository

This repository will contain my solutions to the various challenges I tackle during picoCTF. As I progress through the competition, I'll add explanations of how I approached each challenge, the tools I used, and the flags I obtained.

## Challenges

I will be working on different categories of challenges, including but not limited to:

- Cryptography
- Web Exploitation
- Binary Exploitation
- Reverse Engineering
- Forensics
- General Skills

Each challenge will be explained in its own file, with a detailed write-up on the solution, thought process, and any tools I used.

## Goals

The primary goal of this repository is to track my progress and help me learn more about cybersecurity through solving CTF challenges. I also hope this repository can be helpful for others who are learning and want to see how I approached different types of problems.

## How to Contribute

If you're also working on picoCTF, feel free to fork this repository, submit issues, or contribute your own solutions! Collaboration and learning together are always great.
